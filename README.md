# Vulcan

## Description

Vulcan is a tool to help streamline the process of creating STIG-ready securiy guidance documentation and InSpec automated validation profiles.

Vulcan models the STIG intent form and the process of aligning security controls from high-level DISA Security Requirements Guides (SRGs) into [Security Technical Implementation Guides](public.cyber.mil/stigs) (STIGs) tailored to a particular system component. STIG-ready content developed with Vulcan can be provided to DISA for peer review and formal publishing as a STIG.  Vulcan allows the guidance author to develop both human-readable instructions and machine-readable automated validation code at the same time.

## Features

* Model the STIG creation process between the creator (vendor) and the approver (sponsor)
* Write and test InSpec code on a local system, or across SSH, AWS, and Docker targets
* Easily view control status and revision history
* Enable distributed authorship with multiple authors working on sets of controls and reviewing each others' work
* Confidential data in the database is encrypted using symmetric encryption
* Authenticate via the local server, through GitHub, and through configuring an LDAP server.

Documentation on how to configure additional Vulcan settings such as SMTP, LDAP, etc, are available on the [Vulcan website](https://vulcan.mitre.org/docs/config.html).

## Tasks

### STIG/SRG Puller Task

This application includes a rake task that pulls published Security Requirements Guides (SRGs) and Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) from
public.cyber.mil and saves them locally. This task can be executed manually or set up to run on a schedule in a production environment.

#### Manual Execution

You can manually execute the STIG/SRG puller task by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
bundle exec rails stig_and_srg_puller:pull
```

#### Scheduling the Task in Production

If you wish to automate the execution of this task in a production environment, you can set up a task scheduler on your hosting platform.
The configuration will depend on your specific hosting service.

Generally, you will need to create a job that runs the following command:

```shell
bundle exec rails stig_and_srg_puller:pull
```

You can set the frequency of this task according to your preference or needs. However, it's important to consider the volume of data being pulled
and the impact on the application's performance when deciding on the frequency.

>> Please refer to your hosting platform's documentation or support services for specific instructions on how to set up scheduled tasks or cron jobs.
